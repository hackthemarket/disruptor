Readme file for disruptor project by Tito Ingargiola

This is a partial (1P1C only) implementation of the Disruptor pattern
(https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/) in C++.

Not meant for any particular purpose beyond satisfying my curiosity.
You may use it to do likewise.

To build:

1. Edit src/Makefile.am as needed to identify TBB & boost locations.
2. ./configure
3. ./make
4. src/perftests

When I do that on my vintage 2009 i7 920, I see:

[tito@geobukseon src]$ ./perftests 
set q size to 32768
UniCast1P1CPerfTest OpsPerSecond run #0: BlockingQueue=5,819,931, Disruptor=49,188,391
UniCast1P1CPerfTest OpsPerSecond run #1: BlockingQueue=5,811,700, Disruptor=49,513,120
UniCast1P1CPerfTest OpsPerSecond run #2: BlockingQueue=5,838,052, Disruptor=49,244,911
[tito@geobukseon src]$

This suggests the disruptor is running about 10X faster than boost's
blocking queue.
